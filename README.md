# 🦾 Robot Adventure: A Python OOP Exploration
Welcome to Robot Adventure, a Python-based project that lets you build and control your very own robot! 🚀🤖

This project is a deep dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, using a robot as the centerpiece. The goal? To create an interactive and extensible robot class with a variety of behaviors like movement, combat, and communication—all powered by classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and more!

## 🛠️ Key Features:
- Move & Turn: Command your robot to move forward, turn left or right, and navigate the world!
- Talking Robot: Make your robot speak and interact with you through messages.
- Specialized Robots: Create subclasses like RacingRobot or BattleBot that modify behavior for specific needs.
- Advanced OOP: Demonstrates advanced Python OOP features such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstract Base Classes (ABC), Class Methods, and Static Methods.
- Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance between robots in 2D space using math and static methods.
- Extendable: Easily add new robot types or behaviors (e.g., flying robots, smart assistants) through simple subclassing.

## 🤖 What You Can Do:
- Control Your Robot: Move it in any direction, rotate it, and even make it perform cool actions like jumping or attacking.
- Test the Bots: Run unit tests to ensure everything works perfectly. Includes automated tests for core functionalities like movement, turning, and speaking.
- Experiment: Customize and extend the robot's functionality by modifying or adding new behaviors.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x: The language of choice for its simplicity and versatility.
- OOP Principles: Object-Oriented Programming to organize and structure the robot's functionality.
- Unit Testing: Ensure the integrity of the code with Python's built-in unittest framework.

## 📝 How to Use:
- Clone or download the repository.
- Run `main.py` to interact with your robot.
- Want to create a new robot? Simply subclass the Robot class and override methods like `move_forward()` or `talk()` to give your robot new abilities.
- Run `test_robot.py` to see automated tests in action, ensuring your robot behaves correctly.
